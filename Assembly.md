# Assembly

Tools Needed:
- Screwdriver (Phillips #2)
  
Workspace:
- Clean, flat surface with good lighting

## 1. Install the CPU on the Motherboard

Open the CPU socket latch on the motherboard. 

Align the CPU with the socket (look for the golden triangle or alingment markers).

Gently Place the CPU into the socket (don't force it).

Secure the latch to lock the CPU in place.

## 2. Install the CPU Cooler
Apply a small, pea-sized amount of thermal paste to the top of the CPU if your cooler doesn't come with pre-applied paste.

Attach the cooler to the CPU following the instructions. 

Air Coolers: Secure the fan and heatsink using screws or clips.

Liquid Coolers: Mount the pump block on the CPU and attach the radiator to the case.

Connect the cooler's fan cable to the CPU_FAN header on the motherboard.

## 3. Install RAM
Identify the correct RAM slots by referring to the motherboard manual; often it's slots 2 and 4 for dual-channel memory.

Open the clips on both ends of the slots.

Align the notch on the RAM stick with the slot and firmly push down until the clips lock.

## 4. Install Storage
- For M.2 SSDs:
  - Locate the M.2 slot on the motherboard
  - Insert the SSD at an angle, the press it flat and secure it with a screw.
- For SATA SSDs/HDDs:
  - Mount the drive in a case bay.
  - Connect the SATA data cable to the motherboard and the power cable from the PSU.

 ## 5. Mount the Motherboard in the Case
 Install standoffs in the case to match the holes on the motherboard.

 Align the motherboard with the I/O shield (pre-installed or included with the motherboard).

 Secure the motherboard to the standoffs with screws.

 ## 6. Install the Power Supply (PSU)
 Mount the PSU in its compartment (usually at the bottom rear of the case).

 Secure it with screws.

 Connect the cables:
   - 24-pin ATX cable to the motherboard.
   - 8-pin CPU power cable to the motherboard.
   - PCIe power cables to the GPU (if applicable).
   - SATA/Molex power cables to storage devices.

## 7. Install the Graphics Card (GPU)
Locate the PCIe x 16 slot on the motherboard

Remove the corresponding slot cover(s) on the case.

Insert the GPU into the slot until it clicks.

Secure the GPU to the case using screws.

Connect the PCIe power cables from the PSU.

## 8. Connect Front Panel and Case Cables
Attach the front panel connectors (power switch, reset button, USB, audio, etc.) to the motherboard using the manual for guidance.

Connect case fans to the motherboard or PSU.

## 9. Cable management
Use zip ties or Velcro straps to organize cables neatly.

Route cables through the back of the case for better airflow.

## 10. Perform a preliminary Boot Test
Connect the monitor, keyboard, and power cable.

Turn on the PSU switch and press the power button on the case.

Check for:
  - Fans spinning
  - Display output (BIOS screen)

If it doesn't power on, make sure all cables are properly connected and that components are seated securely.

## 11. Install the Operating System
Insert a bootable USB drive with your operating system.

Access the BIOS/UEFI (press Del, F2, or the specified key during boot).

Set the USB drive as the primary boot device.

Save and exit to begin the OS installation.

## 12. Finalize Setup
Install necessary drivers for the motherboard, GPU, and peripherals.

Update the OS.

Run performance tests to ensure everything works correctly.

Plug in your Wi-Fi card into the motherboard or use an ethernet cable for internet.
